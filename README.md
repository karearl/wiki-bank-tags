# Wiki Bank Tags
Basic plugin to generate bank tags from https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/ categories. This is just a simple replacement for the original [wiki-bank-tag-integration](https://github.com/MitchBarnett/wiki-bank-tag-integration) plugin that seems to be abandoned and is no longer working.

## Usage
Use a chat command with a category from the wiki to generate bank tags. Categories are located at the bottom of any page related to items.

### Example
- ✔️ `::bt quest_items`
- ✔️ `::bt fish`
- ❌ `::bt quest items`
- ❌ `::bt melee_weapons fish`
